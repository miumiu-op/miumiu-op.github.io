I'm using this page to ~~play around GitHub Pages~~ present myself as a technical writer.

## Who am I？

Hello, I'm Miaomiao Pan, but you can call me Miumiu—it's what my friends usually go with. With over 4 years of technical writing experience in Shanghai, China, my journey has spanned various industries, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities.

From industrial robots, B2B SaaS and software development kits, my focus has always been on distilling intricate technical details into clear and accessible documentation.

In these roles, I've honed not only my writing skills but also a commitment to rigorous testing, ensuring that the documentation not only conveys information effectively but also solve users' issues.

What sets me apart is not just my commitment to creating effective documentation but my dedication to streamlining the process through automation tools and a strong adherence to industry standards.

I believe that effective communication is foundational to success, and I'm eager to bring my skills to your team. If there's anything you'd like to discuss or share, please feel free to reach out to [me](mailto:miaomiao_pan@163.com). I'm always open to new opportunities and conversations.
