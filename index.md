I'm using this page to ~~play around GitHub Pages~~ present myself as a technical writer.

## Who am Iï¼Ÿ

My name is Miaomiao Pan, but you can call me Miumiu (most of my friends do). I am an experienced technical writer with over 4 years in the field.

I excel in creating documentation that is both clear and user-friendly, and I am well-versed in various software development contexts. Moreover, I am committed to enhancing the documentation process by leveraging automation tools and adhering to industry standards.

Feel free to contact [me](mailto:miaomiao_pan@163.com) if you have anything to share with me.
