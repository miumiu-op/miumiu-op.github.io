This article delves into my process of writing a user guide for a complext product.

I was assigned to write a guide that aims to introduce two tools designed for scheduling and managing background jobs within a Human Resource solution. The focus of this documentation is to provide comprehensive guidance for users engaging with these tools, catering to both provisioning and administrative environments.

## Writing Approach

While composing the user guide, my writing approach is primarily focused on:

**User-Centricity**: Personally using the tool to ensure document content aligns with real users' needs and expectations.

**Systematic Coverage**: Collaborating with the product manager and customer support to understand features and functionalities from an overall perspective ensures comprehensive documentation.

**Clarity**: Utilizing clear and concise language, complemented by visuals and examples for user-friendly comprehension.

## Challenges Encountered and Solutions

**Challenges**

While these tools share the same fundamental purpose, there exist gaps in their specific functionalities, influenced not only by user permissions between provisioners and administrators, but also by the development timeline. Untangling this intricate relationship and crafting documentation that resonated with both audiences posed a considerable challenge.

**Solution**

Addressing the developmental disparities between Tool A and Tool B, I initiated extensive discussions with various stakeholders, including product managers and documentation architects. Upon reaching a consensus, I meticulously adjusted the documentation structure at both the overall document (directory) and individual document levels.

This proactive effort ensures a clear separation between the two tools, with explicit indications of the tool type and required user permissions, aiming to eliminate any potential confusion for users. 

Furthermore, I adopt a proactive approach to keep the documentation synchronized with ongoing product iterations and future roadmaps, facilitating timely updates based on evolving features and functionalities.
