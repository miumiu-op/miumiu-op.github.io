This project involved updating a documentation set for developers who want to develop interactive online classroom apps using the provided SDK. The documentation set consists of release notes, quickstart guides, feature guides, API reference, etc.

In addition to updating the documentation for new releases, I enriched the content of 50 topics by integrating feedback from both engineers and customer support. This round of content enhancement significantly reduced user-reported issues and tickets, thereby improving the overall user experience.

You can contact me to request certain topics from this document.
