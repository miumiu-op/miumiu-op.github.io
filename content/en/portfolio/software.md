A technical writing project for a human resource solution involved creating a new administrator guide consisting of over 30 topics. In addition to updating the documentation with the new features and changes for the following release, I also created a relationship diagram and an implementation flow chart with clickable hotpot, to help users to understand the solution's workflow and navigate through the system more efficiently.

As this project involved cross-product line integration, I cooperated with stakeholders from two different product lines, I reached an agreement through organization and coordination,

Due to the cross-product integration nature of the product, I encountered varying opinions from stakeholders across different teams. These differences encompassed aspects such as document positioning, the relationship with the two integrated products, design of document homepages and structures, and collaborative workflows for document content. Through organization and coordination efforts, I successfully facilitated alignment among the stakeholders, ultimately reaching consensus on these matters.
